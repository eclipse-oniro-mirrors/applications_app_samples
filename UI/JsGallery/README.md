# Gallery App

### Introduction

This JS-based gallery app offers the image browsing functions. It uses the lazy loading feature to improve performance. You can add or replace image resources as needed to build your own gallery.

### Usage

1.  The initial page consists of 200 images, which are displayed in eight columns.

2.  An icon is provided in the upper right corner for you to switch between 4, 8, and 12 columns.
 
3.  A **Settings** button is provided in the upper left corner for you to access the **Settings** page. After you set the number of columns and the total number of images and touch **OK**, the home screen is updated according to your settings.

### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices and applies to large-system devices (reference memory â‰¥ 1 GiB).
