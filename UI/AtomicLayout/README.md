### Introduction<a name="section104mcpsimp"></a>

This sample illustrates style attributes related to layout effect adaptation, including the hiding feature, proportion feature, and fixed ratio.

With the hiding feature, you can adjust the display priority of components in a container in the horizontal or vertical direction.

With the proportion feature, you can adjust the proportion of each component in a container so that each of them is always arranged in a proportional space of the container.

You can scale up or down a component with fixed ratio while retaining its aspect ratio.

### Usage<a name="section110mcpsimp"></a>

In this sample, there are three buttons on the home screen. You can click them to display the corresponding screen.

On the feature display screen, the rectangle in light yellow is a container, and it accommodates three components: A, B, and C. You can click the buttons to change the size of the components and display them in different ways.

### Constraints<a name="section116mcpsimp"></a>
