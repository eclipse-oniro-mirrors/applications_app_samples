# Radio

### Introduction

This sample uses eTS to show how to use the radio function of the telephony service to obtain information, including the radio access technology, network status, network selection mode, ISO country code, signal strength list, and whether the radio function is enabled.

### Usage

1. When you tap **SIM1 status**, information including the radio access technology, registered network signal strength list, network selection mode, and ISO country code of SIM card 1 will be displayed on the screen.
  The information will disappear if you tap on the screen again. The case is the same as you tap **SIM2 status**.

2. **NetworkState** displays information about the network status.

3. **IsRadioOn** indicates whether the radio function is enabled. The value **true** indicates that the radio function is enabled, and the value **false** indicates the opposite.

### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.
