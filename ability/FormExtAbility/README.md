# Stage Model Widget

### Introduction

This sample shows how to create and use the widget provider in the stage model.

### Usage

1. The home screens of some devices do not support widgets. You can create, update, and delete widgets by using your own widget host. For details, see [Widget Host](../FormLauncher/README.md).

2. The following figure shows the widget style. When the widget is updated, the temperature and time on the widget change.
