### WebGL

##### Introduction

This sample shows how to use WebGL APIs to draw pentagrams and rectangles by invoking GPU resources.

##### How to Use

1. Touch the **Pentagram** button. A pentagram is displayed on the canvas.

2. Touch the **Rectangle** button. A rectangle is displayed on the canvas.

##### Constraints

1. This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.

2. The device that runs the sample app must have the capability of invoking GPU resources. For example, an RK3568-powered device has this capability, but a device running the Hi3516 development board does not have this capability.

3. This sample requires DevEco Studio 3.0 Beta4 (Build Version: 3.0.0.992, built on July 14, 2022) to compile and run.
